I would like to make an app that makes it easy to save recipes from all sorts of apps or websites. This app will be the hub for all saved recipes on the media and also help the user organize. Features include organizing the recipes by the type of cuisine, how long it would take to cook, and the ingredients that they are using. How I envision this app: you would open it and there are two parts: add recipes, and review saved recipes. When you add recipes, it is able to take a link or whatever you used to get that recipe and scrapes the data, adding it to your review recipes. In the review recipe, there is sections that separates review by cuisine, duration, and available ingredients. When you click on the recipe, it should say all the necessary information about it such as where was the recipe retrieved by, prep time, any helpful videos etc

## Notes

Dragging button to ViewController Class was a challenge.
